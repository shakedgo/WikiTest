        <h4>Main</h4>
        <p>
            Ultimate Spinach is the 1968 self-titled debut album by the American <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock"> psychedelic rock</a> band,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spinach"> Ultimate Spinach</a>, and was released on the MGM
            Records label (E/SE-4518) simultaneously with the debut LP of two other Boston area bands,
            Beacon Street Union and Orpheus. Both albums were heavily promoted by the label as being representative of
            the
            "Bosstown Sound".
            The commercial ploy was heavily driven in psychedelic music that attempted to replicate the San Francisco
            Sound.

        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>Ian Bruce-Douglas composed all the songs, played several instruments, and sang lead for most of the tracks.

            Apart from its obvious references about the use of psychedelic drugs, Ultimate Spinach is a concept album
            based
            on abstract anti-war sentiment, in the context of the Vietnam War that happened at that time. Lyrically,
            Bruce-Douglas' songs are subtle, pretty intricate and with an imaginary vision of life.

            One of the most notable characteristics is its experimental style, with "artifacts" and unusual recording
            techniques, among which stand out a variety of guitar sounds and distortions including fuzz, echo, tremolo,
            feedback, volume control, and use of the wah-wah pedal. Each of those aspects were similar to the typical
            West
            Coast psychedelic sound of the era.

            With the publicity backing them, the band toured with prominent musical acts like Big Brother and the
            Holding
            Company and The Youngbloods at significant venues like the Filmore Auditorium.

            Following their recording and initial tour, drummer Keith Lahtenein left the group to by replaced Russell
            Levine. Priscilla DiDonato was also added to the lineup at this time. The addition enabled the band to more
            closely recreate the overdubbed vocal harmonies in their debut album.[2]</p>

                <p>The album was Ultimate Spinach's most successful when it peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200.

                    In 2008, the album still retained its presence as a psychedelic classic when it was listed at number
                    36
                    on Classic Rock magazine's "42 Greatest Psychedelic Albums".
