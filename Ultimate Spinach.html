    <h4>Main</h4>
    <p>
        Ultimate Spinach is the 1968 self-titled debut album by the American <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_rock"> psychedelic rock</a> band,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spinach"> Ultimate Spinach</a>, and was released on the MGM
        Records label (E/SE-4518) simultaneously with the debut LP of two other Boston area bands,
        Beacon Street Union and Orpheus. Both albums were heavily promoted by the label as being representative of the
        "Bosstown Sound".
        The commercial ploy was heavily driven in psychedelic music that attempted to replicate the San Francisco Sound.

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>Ian Bruce-Douglas composed all the songs, played several instruments, and sang lead for most of the tracks.

        Apart from its obvious references about the use of psychedelic drugs, Ultimate Spinach is a concept album based
        on abstract anti-war sentiment, in the context of the Vietnam War that happened at that time. Lyrically,
        Bruce-Douglas' songs are subtle, pretty intricate and with an imaginary vision of life.

        One of the most notable characteristics is its experimental style, with "artifacts" and unusual recording
        techniques, among which stand out a variety of guitar sounds and distortions including fuzz, echo, tremolo,
        feedback, volume control, and use of the wah-wah pedal. Each of those aspects were similar to the typical West
        Coast psychedelic sound of the era.

        With the publicity backing them, the band toured with prominent musical acts like Big Brother and the Holding
        Company and The Youngbloods at significant venues like the Filmore Auditorium.

        Following their recording and initial tour, drummer Keith Lahtenein left the group to by replaced Russell
        Levine. Priscilla DiDonato was also added to the lineup at this time. The addition enabled the band to more
        closely recreate the overdubbed vocal harmonies in their debut album.[2]</p>
